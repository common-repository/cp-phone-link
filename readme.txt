This plugin will add a link to a custom phone number field, allowing users to click on it and make a direct call from their phone.

== Description ==

This plugin requires <a href="https://www.appthemes.com/themes/classipress/?aid=26553" target="_blank">Classipress</a> theme to be installed.

If you are an owner of a <a href="https://www.appthemes.com/themes/classipress/?aid=26553" target="_blank">Classipress</a> site, then you might have created a custom field for storing and displaying seller's phone number. But this field is no special field, it just shows information like any other.

After you install this plugin, field with a phone number will become a link you can click on and if you are using your phone you will be able to dial the number directly.

You can even add an icon on the left or right side of the number. There are 12 icons to choose from, and you can add your own if you like. Just copy them to plugin images folder.
